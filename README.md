# Pandas-Challenge

You'll find the script called PyCitySchools.ipynb in the PyCitySchools folder, it's going to read the two cvs files located in the Resources folder called 	schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv and returns a series of dataset correlating the data stored in the two files and in order to analyze it.
 Also in the PyCitySchools.ipynb file you'll find my analysis of the trends that can be observed at the very top of the script.
 
 All the script is made by me, following the starter code provided with the resources and the class materials.
